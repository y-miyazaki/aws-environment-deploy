# GitHub Actions Workflow Code Review

This skill provides comprehensive guidance for reviewing GitHub Actions Workflow configurations to ensure correctness, security, and best practices compliance.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill is applicable for:

- Performing code reviews on GitHub Actions Workflow pull requests
- Checking workflow configurations before merging
- Ensuring security and compliance standards
- Validating best practices adherence
- Architecture and design review

**Note**: Linting and auto-checkable items (YAML syntax, runs-on missing, step names) are excluded from this review as they should be caught by actionlint/yamllint in CI/CD pipelines.

## Review Process

### Step 1: Understand Context

Before starting the review:

- Read the PR description and linked issues
- Understand the workflow purpose and trigger conditions
- Check if this is new workflow, enhancement, or bug fix
- Verify related documentation updates

### Step 2: Automated Checks First

Verify automated validation has passed:

- `actionlint`
- `ghalint`
- `zizmor`

If automated checks fail, request fixes before manual review.

### Step 3: Systematic Review

Review categories systematically based on the changes. Use the reference documentation for detailed checks in each category.

### Step 4: Report Issues

Report issues following the Output Format below, including only failed checks with specific recommendations.

## Output Format

Review results must be output in structured format:

### Output Elements

1. **Checks** (Review items checklist)
   - Display only failed review items
   - Format: `ItemID ItemName: ❌ Fail`
   - Purpose: Highlight issues requiring attention
   - If all checks pass, output "No issues found"

2. **Issues** (Detected problems)
   - Display details for each failed item
   - Numbered list format for each problem
   - Each issue includes:
     - Item ID + Item Name
     - File: file path and line number
     - Problem: Description of the issue
     - Impact: Scope and severity
     - Recommendation: Specific fix suggestion with code example

### Output Format Example

```markdown
# GitHub Actions Workflow Code Review Result

## Checks

- SEC-03 Careful pull_request_target Usage: ❌ Fail

## Issues

**No issues found** (if all checks pass)

**OR**

1. SEC-03: Careful pull_request_target Usage
   - File: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` L23
   - Problem: Using pull_request_target without proper protections
   - Impact: Arbitrary code execution and secret exposure from external PRs possible
   - Recommendation: Switch to pull_request or add fork validation in if conditions

2. PERF-02: Parallelization Opportunity
   - File: `.github/workflows/test.yml` L45-60
   - Problem: Sequence execution with parallelizable jobs
   - Impact: Long CI/CD times reduce development velocity
   - Recommendation: Use matrix or parallel jobs
```

## Available Review Categories

Review categories are organized by domain. Claude will read the relevant category file(s) based on the workflow being reviewed.

**Global & Base**: Workflow names and triggers → [reference/global.md](reference/global.md)
**Error Handling**: continue-on-error patterns → [reference/error-handling.md](reference/error-handling.md)
**Tool Integration**: Actions and composite actions → [reference/tool-integration.md](reference/tool-integration.md)
**Security**: pull_request_target and secrets → [reference/security.md](reference/security.md)
**Performance**: Caching and parallelization → [reference/performance.md](reference/performance.md)
**Best Practices**: Reusability and maintainability → [reference/best-practices.md](reference/best-practices.md)

## Best Practices

When performing code reviews:

- **Constructive and specific**: Include code examples and official documentation references
- **Context-aware**: Understand PR purpose and requirements, consider tradeoffs
- **Clear priorities**: Distinguish between "must fix" and "nice to have"
- **Prevent security oversights**: Pay special attention to SEC-\* items
- **Prioritize automation**: Avoid excessive focus on actionlint/ghalint/zizmor

## Summary

This skill provides:

1. **Comprehensive review guidelines** - 6 categories covering all aspects
2. **Structured output format** - Consistent, parseable review results
3. **Clear process** - Step-by-step review workflow
4. **Prioritization** - Critical vs. minor issues
5. **Actionable recommendations** - Specific fix suggestions with code examples
6. **Domain-specific organization** - Load only relevant categories for efficient token usage
