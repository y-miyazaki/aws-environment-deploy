### 15. Cost Optimization (COST)

**COST-01: Avoid High-Cost Metrics/Long Retention**

- Problem: Unnecessary costs, excessive retention periods
- Impact: Budget overruns, wasted costs
- Recommendation: Retain only necessary periods/metrics, optimize costs
- Check: Retention periods and metric collection are justified

**COST-02: Mass Resource Creation Cost Justification**

- Problem: Excessive resource provisioning, insufficient cost estimation
- Impact: Cost increase, budget overruns, low ROI
- Recommendation: Justify cost-effectiveness, verify necessity, consider alternatives
- Check: Large-scale resource creation has cost analysis

**COST-03: Minimize Optional Defaults (monitoring/xray/retention)**

- Problem: Unnecessary option enablement, all defaults enabled
- Impact: Wasted costs, complexity, management burden
- Recommendation: Enable options only when needed, default to minimal configuration
- Check: Optional features explicitly enabled with justification
